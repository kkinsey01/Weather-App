# Weather-App

Hello, this is my weather app I created using Python. For the GUI, I used PySimpleGUI. To get weather data, I used OpenWeatherMap's API. Using this, I was able to access weather information through a json file. For part of the program, I used IPStack's API. This gave me the ability to access the physical location in which the program was being ran from. I was able to access the data using a json file again. 

The app is split into 4 files to maintain cleanliness and readibility. The program is ran from gui.py. WeatherData.py is for any information regarding the APIs, so weather data and accessing the ip address. The other files only have one use each. forecastGUI.py is used to generate the window containing the forecast of the next 5 days from the time the program is ran. gui_functions.py gives the ability to change the location a user my search for and easily update the interface. 

The images folder is currently not being used. I wanted to provide a simple logo style image next to the different data types, but I am not familiar enough with PySimpleGUI and Python to deal with scaling the images appropriately and providing a clear image. In the future, I do want this to be a part of the app.

I will provide some screenshots of the program being ran here.
